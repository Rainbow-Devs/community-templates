## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you come across a bug in our software, please report it by creating a new issue on the GitHub repository. Please provide as much information as possible about the issue and the steps needed to reproduce it.

Please ensure that your bug report follows the bug report template. If you're not sure how to report your bug, please reach out to a maintainer of the repository for help.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have ideas on how to improve or add new features to our software, please create a new issue for that as well. Describe your idea in detail so we can fully understand what you're suggesting.

### Code Contribution

If you'd like to contribute to our codebase, here's the process:

1. **Fork the Repository**: You need to create your own copy of the project on GitHub. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button at the top-right of the repository page.

2. **Clone the Repository**: After forking the repository, clone it to your local machine by running:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/repository-name.git
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and create a new branch by running:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes**: Now, you can start editing files. Make sure the changes you're making align with our project's style guide and standards.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: After making your changes, stage and commit them:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "<commit-message>"
   ```

6. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

7. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to your repository on GitHub, you will see a "Compare & pull request" button. Click on it and submit a PR with a clear description of your changes following the pull request template.

## Code Standards

- Make sure your code adheres to our project's coding conventions (e.g., indentation, comment style, naming conventions).
- Write clear, maintainable, and easy-to-understand code.
- Always document new code based on our documentation standards.
- Write tests for your code if applicable.

## Pull Request Process

(See our pull request template for more details)

- The title of the PR should be descriptive, reflecting its purpose as clearly as possible.
- The PR must pass all continuous integration checks (like builds, tests, code quality checks, etc.).
- The changes introduced by the PR should be covered by tests, if applicable.
- The maintainer of the repository will review the PR and might ask for changes to be made. If changes are requested, modify your changes, commit them, and push them to your branch. They will automatically be added to the PR.
- Once the PR has been approved, the changes will be merged into the main project's codebase.

Again, thank you for your contribution. We appreciate your help in making Rainbow Devs better!
